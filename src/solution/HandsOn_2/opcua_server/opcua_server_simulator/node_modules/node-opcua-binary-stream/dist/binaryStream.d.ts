/**
 * a BinaryStream can be use to perform sequential read or write
 * inside a buffer.
 * The BinaryStream maintains a cursor up to date as the caller
 * operates on the stream using the various read/write methods.
 * It uses the [Little Endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_endian#Little-endian)
 * It uses the [Little Endian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_endian#Little-endian)
 * convention.
 *
 * data can either be:
 *
 * * a Buffer , in this case the BinaryStream operates on this Buffer
 * * null     , in this case a BinaryStream with 1024 bytes is created
 * * any data , in this case the object is converted into a binary buffer.
 *
 * example:
 *
 *    ``` javascript
 *    var stream = new BinaryStream(32)
 *    ```
 *
 * @class BinaryStream
 * @param {null|Buffer|Number} data
 * @constructor
