/**
 * from https://reference.opcfoundation.org/v104/Core/docs/Part3/8.58/:
 *
 * This is a subtype of the UInt32 DataType with the OptionSetValues Property defined.
 * It is used to indicate how the Value of a Variable can be accessed (read/write),
 * if it contains current and/or historic data and its atomicity.
 * The AccessLevelExType DataType is an extended version of the AccessLevelType DataType and
 * as such contains the 8 bits of the AccessLevelType as the first 8 bits.
 * The NonatomicRead, and NonatomicWrite Fields represent the atomicity of a Variable.
 *  In general Atomicity is expected of OPC UA read and write operations.
 * These Fields are used by systems, in particular hard-realtime controllers, which can not ensure atomicity.
